# How to contribute
We ❤️ pull requests. If you'd like to fix a bug, contribute a feature or
just correct a typo, please feel free to do so, as long as you follow
our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Shopify/graphql-ruby-client/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
and the [Contributing Developer Certificate of Origin](https://github.com/Shopify/graphql-ruby-client/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING_DEVELOPER_CERTIFICATE_OF_ORIGIN.txt).

If you're thinking of adding a big new feature, consider opening an
issue first to discuss it to ensure it aligns to the direction of the
project (and potentially save yourself some time!).

## Getting Started
To start working on the codebase, first fork the repo, then clone it:
```
git clone git@github.com:your-username/graphql-ruby-client.git
```
*Note: replace "your-username" with your Github handle*

Install the project's dependencies:
```
bundle install
```

Write some features and add the corresponding tests (or in the other order for
bonus points!) Run the tests with:

```
bin/rake test
```
